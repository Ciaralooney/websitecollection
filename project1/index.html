            <!-- Paragraph of information about The Amazing World of Gumball -->
            <p>The Amazing World of Gumball first aired on Cartoon Network in 2011. It follows the life of Gumball
                Watterson, Darwin Watterson and their many friends and
               <abbr title="Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole and Richard">family</abbr>.
            </p>
            <p>The Watterson family has a flair for misadventure and with each episode we see how they traverse through
               a newfound problem in their hometown of Elmore.
            </p>
            <p>Gumball Watterson; a 12-year-old cat, is the main character of the series. Below are a picture of a few
                of his friends.

            <p>But Gumball's best friend isn't anyone from school, it is his 10-year-old brother Darwin. The 2 brothers
                always find themselves in trouble. Sometimes their little sister Anais (a 4-year-old rabbit with extreme
                intelligence) ends up tagging along too. You can see an example of this below.
